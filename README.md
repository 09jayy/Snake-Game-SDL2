# Snake-Game-SDL2

## Description

This repository consists of a recreation of the classic game: Snake. The purpose of this project is to familiarise myself with more low level concepts that happen within the computer when programming, hence the usage of C++. Additionally, uses the SDL2 library for graphics.
